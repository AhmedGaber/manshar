# Contributing to Manshar

So, you'll give us a hand building [Manshar](http://www.manshar.com)? AWESOME! Here, you can find some guidelines that should help you get started quickly and easily. If you need any help, please email us at core@manshar.com or [manshar’s mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/manshar-core). We're always happy to answer your questions!


##How we work?
We mostly use [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/985678) for tracking all the things we still need done, and we use [Slack](https://slack.com) to do all communications manshar-related. Read our [Governance Model](https://github.com/manshar/manshar/wiki/Governance-Model) to learn more.

##How to contribute?
There are lots of ways you can contribute, here's some things you can help us with:

 - You can work on the backend of Manshar
 - You can help us with the UX and UI
 - You can report an issue
 - Or write tests
 - You can write the documentation with us
 - You can help us with the graphics and design
 - Tell us your opinions and feature suggestions

## Development Technologies:
Manshar is built using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) on the backend and [AngualrJS](https://angularjs.org/) on the frontend. We are also using [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) as a DBMS and [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) as a part of testing the javascript application. Frontend and backend are completely seperated to give you a better chance at contributing to the project if you're familiar with just one technology or if you want to contribute to one of them without wanting to deal with the other.

To start developing Manshar, you need the following installed in your machine:

 - Ruby ≥ 2.0
 - Rails 4.1.8
 - PostgreSQL DBMS
 - PhantomJS
 - NodeJS
