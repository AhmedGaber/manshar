# Contributing to Manshar

So, you'll give us a hand building [Manshar](http://www.manshar.com)? AWESOME! Here, you can find some guidelines that should help you get started quickly and easily. If you need any help, please email us at core@manshar.com or [our mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/manshar-core). We're always happy to answer your questions!


##How we work?
We mostly use [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/985678) for tracking all the things we still need done, and we use [Slack](https://slack.com) to do all communications manshar-related. Read our [Governance Model](https://github.com/manshar/manshar/wiki/Governance-Model) to learn more.

##How to contribute?
Whatever your area of expertise is, there are lots of ways you can contribute, here are some things you can help us with:

 - Use the app to write your own story! If you haven't already, [try it out](https://www.manshar.com/signup/)! Understanding the app will help you take the first step. Really!
 - You can report an issue
 - Work on the backend
 - Help us with the UX and UI
 - Or write some tests
 - Maybe you can write the documentation with us?
 - Or help us with the graphics and design...
 - Tell us your opinions and feature suggestions
 - Or help us spread the word!

## Technologies we use:
Manshar is built using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) on the backend and [AngualrJS](https://angularjs.org/) on the frontend. We are also using [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database and [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) as a part of testing the javascript application. **Frontend and backend are completely separated to give you a better chance at contributing to the project if you're familiar with just one technology or if you want to contribute to one of them without wanting to deal with the other**.
